This folder contains interactive iPython notebooks containing adapted figures from the submitted article with the title:

# A Careful Consideration of the Influence of Structure, Partial charges and Basis Sets on Collision Cross Sections of Monosaccharides when Comparing Values from DFT calculations to those Obtained Experimentally
authored by: 
## Lukasz G. Migas, Christopher J. Gray, Sabine L. Flitsch and Perdita E. Barran

The data showcased in the publication is relatively dense, with a large number of datapoints. In our opinion, the readers would benefit from being able to interrogate each dataset in detail. The notebooks were designed to contain figures practically identical to those in the paper (in terms of datasets). The reader is able to hover, zoom and select/deselect datasets for comparison.
