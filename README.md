This folder contains interactive iPython notebooks containing adapted figures from the submitted article with the title:

# The remarkable influence of structure, partial charges and basis sets on subsequent evaluation of collision cross sections of monosaccharides
authored by: 
## Lukasz G. Migas, Christopher J. Gray, Sabine L. Flitsch and Perdita E. Barran

The data showcased in the publication is relatively dense, with a large number of datapoints. In our opinion, the readers would benefit from being able to interrogate each dataset in detail. The notebooks were designed to contain figures practically identical to those in the paper (in terms of datasets). The reader is able to hover, zoom and select/deselect datasets for comparison. 

The directory contains multiple files:
## [Partial atomic charges - figures.ipynb](https://github.com/lukasz-migas/ChargePaper_2017/blob/master/Partial%20atomic%20charges%20-%20figures.ipynb)
This file contains a number of plots (with subplots within) containing all data show in the article which relates to the computationally obtained partial atomic charges.

## [Collision Cross Sections - figures.ipynb](https://github.com/lukasz-migas/ChargePaper_2017/blob/master/Collision%20cross%20sections%20-%20figures.ipynb)
This file contains a number of plots (with subplots within) containing all data shown in the article which relates to the computationally obtained collision cross sections and the experimental collision cross section distribution.
